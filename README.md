-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.

● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.

● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

● ‘No_show’ it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

Results:

The percentage of patients is more women than men, and this information can be used to determine the quantity and type of magazines and newspapers used in the waiting room.

age has clear influence on showing rate, ages from 0 to 8 are the most showing, then from 45 to 55 and the least showing are patients above 65.

number of showing patients without receiving sms is greater than showing patients with sms.

so we need to revisit our sms company to make our sms more efficient.

Receiving the scholarship is not an indication of the patient's attendance.

the prevalence of chronic disease in showing patients is a little.

Limitations:

1) most of our dataset is categorical so we can't make more statistical analysis.

2) need more information about the mechanism of work in sms company. to make more analysis in this feature.
